# keylogger-chef
this is simple python keylogger
This is a simple keylogger that I wrote for educational purposes and to better understand how malware works.
SERVER FILE:
First, set the IP and port in the keylogger-server file, and after running the file, the program will be in listening mode, and when the target executes the keylogger-client file, the target IP and port will be displayed on the server.
CLIENT FILE:
Then you should open the keylogger-client file in notepad and set the IP and port of the previous file, that is, the server.
